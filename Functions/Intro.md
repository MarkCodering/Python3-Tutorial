# Introduction to Function in Python
## What is a function?
Function is a block of code which only runs when it is called. This block of code is used to perform a specific task. Therefore, we could encapsulate the code into a function to reuse it later.

## How to declare a function and call it?
### Basic Form
```python
def function_name(parameter_list):
    # function body
    return value
```
### How to define a function with multiple return values?
```python
def function_name(parameter_list):
    # function body
    return value1, value2, value3
