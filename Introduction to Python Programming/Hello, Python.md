# Introduction to Python Programming
## What is Python 
Python is a interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language. It has been around for a long time and is used in a wide variety of applications. From web application to machine learning, you can take advantage of Python to solve problems. As Python is a high-level programming language, the designer has encapsulated the details of the language in a way that is easy to use. However, there are still a lot of concepts to learn in order to master Python programming language.
- Data Types
- Control Flows
- Functions
- Classes and Objects
- Python Primitive Data Structure
- Python Frameworks

## Python Style of Programming
As Python is a high level programming language, it is easy to write a function source code but not in the style of Python. For the programmers from C-like languages, it is easy to write a function but not in the style of Python. Therefore, it is important for us in this course to learn how to write a source code in Python style while fully taking advantage of the Python language.

For example, instead of writing for loop in
```
i = 0
for i in range(0,10):
    print(i)
```
We could actualy rewrite the code as
```
for i in range(0,10):
    print(i)
```
or 
```
for i in data:
    print(i)
```

## Python verus C
Python is a high level programming language with a lot of high-level feature. For example, it can build a HTTP server with just single line of code. However, since Python is a interpreted language, the speed of execution is not as fast as C/C++. Therefore, we as a software engineers, we often use Python to build the draft or the prototype of the source code and implement it in the C/C++ language if the speed of execution is critical.

## How to run Python script on your computer?
To run Python script on your computer, you need to install Python on your computer. You can download Python from [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Also, you could use virtual environment like Anaconda to run Python script. It is better to use virtual environment to run Python script because it is easier to install Python on your computer and it is possible to isolate the development environment for the project.

## Hello world, Python
To run a hello world script in Python to test the installation of Python on your computer, you can use the following code.
```Python
print("Hello, Python!")
```
Note: The detail idea of this script will be explained in the lecture section.
